I have always been interested in working with/on computers in some way. Before I decided to attend Flatiron School, I was going to my local community college to become a Network Engineer. It was fun for a few classes until we had to learn about IP assignment/management. That class kicked my butt. It was the sole reason I dropped out of the course.

A few months of working another dead-end factory job and my friend tells me an idea he has. He wants to teach himself Python to build himself a stock trading bot. The first time I saw some of his code I thought, "Wow. This looks incredibly cool!" Just the look of his Atom text editor hooked me. From then on, I have watched tons of YouTube videos trying to teach myself and make a career out of this. I then ran into the problem I feel most beginners run into. I did not know where to start or what information to pay attention to. There was just too much information!

Earlier this year I decided I would never fully see my potential if I did not seek out a school of some kind. Thankfully, Flatiron was one of the first few schools that came up when I was looking. I could not be happier with the amount of organized information, resources, and student run study groups I see every day. Just knowing that those resources are available gives me a sigh of relief when trying to absorb all this information.

Thank you to all the Flatiron staff for taking time out of their day to assist with labs. I appreciate all the work you do.
